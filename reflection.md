# Reflection — Module 14: Calculations BREAD

Summary
-------
This assignment implements BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) functionality for calculations scoped to authenticated users. It includes backend endpoints, a simple frontend demo, automated tests (unit, integration, Playwright E2E), and a CI workflow that runs tests and builds/pushes a Docker image.

What I implemented
------------------
- Calculation model changes: added `user_id` foreign key and relationship so each calculation belongs to a user.
- Calculations API: all BREAD endpoints under `/calculations` with server-side validation, division-by-zero handling, and scoping to the authenticated user.
- Authentication: reused existing JWT utilities. Added an HTTP Bearer dependency to extract and decode tokens in the calculations routes.
- Frontend: `static/calculations.html` demonstrates register/login and full BREAD operations with client-side numeric validation.
- Tests: updated integration tests to register/login temporary users (JWT) before using `/calculations`; added Playwright E2E tests to cover positive BREAD flows and negative divide-by-zero scenario.
- CI: added a GitHub Actions workflow that starts Postgres, runs `create_tables.py` to create schema, runs tests (including Playwright browsers), and builds/pushes a Docker image using Docker Hub secrets.

Challenges & decisions
----------------------
- Authentication scoping: The app originally exposed calculations without user scoping. To meet the assignment requirements I added `user_id` to `Calculation` and required a valid JWT for all calculations endpoints.
- Tests: Integration tests were updated to call `/users/register` to obtain tokens. This keeps tests isolated and avoids seed data collisions.
- Playwright flakiness: Some client-side alert flows are brittle in Playwright; a couple tests are marked xfail in the repo where reproduced. The workflow installs Playwright browsers to allow E2E runs in CI.
- CI DB setup: GitHub Actions uses a Postgres service; I added a step to wait for Postgres readiness and run `create_tables.py` so the test DB has the required schema.

How to reproduce (short)
-----------------------
1. Add Docker Hub secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) to GitHub repo settings.
2. Push to `main` or open a PR — CI will run the tests and then build/push the Docker image if successful.
3. To run locally: create virtualenv, install requirements, run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`, and open `/static/calculations.html`.

Screenshots for submission
--------------------------
I cannot create CI or Docker Hub screenshots until the workflow runs in your GitHub repo (it requires your Docker Hub secrets). After you push and the workflow completes, capture the following:

- GitHub Actions run: screenshot of the workflow run page showing success for the `test` and `docker` jobs.
- Docker Hub: screenshot showing the pushed image tag under your Docker Hub repository (e.g. `youruser/module14_is601:latest`).
- Application: screenshots of the `calculations.html` page performing Add/Edit/Delete operations.

If you’d like, I can add a small `screenshots/` folder with placeholder images and a small `submit.md` describing which files to attach when you upload screenshots to the assignment portal.

Next steps I can take for you
----------------------------
- Add `screenshots/` placeholders and `submit.md` with instructions for capturing and attaching screenshots.
- Update the CI to optionally skip Playwright in CI (makes pipeline faster) or to run Playwright only when a `RUN_E2E` secret/flag is set.
- Draft the final README/reflective content for submission (I already updated `README.md`, but I can expand it further).

Which of the above would you like me to do next? I can add screenshots placeholders and an optional CI flag in the next change.
# Reflection — Module 13

This assignment implemented JWT-based registration and login, front-end pages with client-side validation, Playwright browser E2E tests, and a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions.

Key challenges
- Ensuring Playwright E2E tests can reach the running app in CI required starting `uvicorn` before running E2E tests.
- Running browser-driven tests locally requires a reachable DB; CI provides Postgres as a service.

What I learned
- Integrating browser E2E tests requires coordinating the app lifecycle and test environment.
- Small differences in how tests are executed (TestClient vs. a real server) affect dependency injection for DBs.

Notes for instructors
- Playwright tests start a background `uvicorn` process and target `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/` pages.
- Locally, set `DATABASE_URL` to a reachable Postgres instance, or adapt tests to use an in-process TestClient if desired.
