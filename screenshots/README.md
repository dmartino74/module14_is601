This folder is a placeholder for screenshots required for the assignment submission.

Place the following images here before zipping or uploading:

- `ci_success.png` — screenshot of GitHub Actions showing successful `test` and `docker` jobs.
- `docker_push.png` — screenshot showing the pushed Docker image on Docker Hub.
- `bread_frontend.png` — screenshot(s) of `static/calculations.html` performing Create / Read / Update / Delete.

If you prefer, instead of saving images here you can upload them to the assignment portal and link to them in `reflection.md`.
